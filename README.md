## Udacity Android Development Projects

This is a git repository for several apps created whilst learning Android Development via the [Udacity Android Basics nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803) and other Udacity Android Development classes.

The different folders are for different apps that were made throughout the course. A brief explanation of each app is given below:

- BirthdayCard: A single page app, which displays an image, with a text overlay wishing someone a happy birthday.
- CourtCounter: A basketball score keeping app.
- JustJava: A coffee ordering app, which "orders" a certain number of coffee's for the user and displays the total price. The original app also included an odering mechanic where it would open the user's email client with the order, but this was removed to make testing the app easier.
- MusicPlayer: A basic music player app that can play, pause and restart one song (the song in this app was taken from [www.bensound.com](www.bensound.com)).
- TKDTheory: An early version of the Tae Kwon-Do theory app now hosted on a separate [repository](https://github.com/PianoManDanDan/TKD-Theory-App).
- ud839_Miwok-Starter-code: An app to teach users basic words and phrases in the [Miwok lanugage](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Miwok). The app provides sound files for each of the words, as well as spellings and translations. The app also uses ViewPager to easily navigate between the different subsections (numbers, family members, colours and phrases).
- ViewPager Example Quiz: A basic app that displays the days of the week and allows you to swipe between them (a tutorial app for how to use ViewPagers).
